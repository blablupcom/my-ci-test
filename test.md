As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

Now we define a sequence of points in H, {P[i] : i ≥ 1}, as:

*   $P_1 = (13, 61/4)$.
*   $P_2 = (-43/6, -4)$.
*   For $i > 2$, $P_i$ is the unique point in H that is different from $P_{i-1}$
    and such that line $P_iP_{i-1}$ is parallel to line $P_{i-2}X$. It can be
    shown that $P_i$ is well-defined, and that its coordinates are always
    rational.

You are given that P[3] = (-19/2, -229/24), P[4] = (1267/144, -37/12) and
P[7] = (17194218091/143327232, 274748766781/1719926784).
