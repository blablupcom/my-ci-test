As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is
24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, s[k] = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k^3] (modulo 1000000) − 500000.

For 56 ≤ k ≤ 4000000, s[k] = [s[k−24] + s[k−55] + 1000000] (modulo 1000000) − 500000.

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, s[k] = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k^3] \(modulo 1000000) − 500000.

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, s[k] = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k^3]\(modulo 1000000) − 500000.

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, s[k] = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k^3]\ (modulo 1000000) − 500000.
